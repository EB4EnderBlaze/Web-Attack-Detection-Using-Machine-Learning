# Web-Attack-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project was performed as part of my final year during my Bachelors in Technology degree at College of Engineering, Pune, India.

Aim: To be able to detect whether a message sent over the Internet is a safe message or a type of web attack, as well as classify what type of attack it is.
Tech Stack: Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Used the UNSW-NB15 dataset for the system, which contains over 10,000 records of messages and their attack type
- Used Weka to stimulate algorithms for testing the system to find out which was the most efficient at attack detection
- The dataset was pre-processed and sent to algorithms â€“ Tree/Bayes/Rule-based - to analyze the efficiency of which one is best. Reports on this can be found in the attached PDF.

At the time of this project, the mentioned research paper in Chapter 8 was not published yet; however, this paper is now published and can be found at the link below:
